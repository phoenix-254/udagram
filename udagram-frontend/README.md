## A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 

***
> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [The RestAPI Backend](https://github.com/phoenix-254/udagram/tree/master/udagram-restapi). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate.

***
### Configure The Backend Endpoint
Ionic uses enviornment files located in `./src/enviornments/enviornment.*.ts` to load configuration variables at runtime. By default `environment.ts` is used for development and `enviornment.prod.ts` is used for produciton. The `apiHost` variable should be set to your server url either locally or in the cloud.

***
### Running the Development Server
Ionic CLI provides an easy to use development server to run and autoreload the frontend. This allows you to make quick changes and see them in real time in your browser. To run the development server, open terminal and run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

### Building the Static Frontend Files
Ionic CLI can build the frontend into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files. These files can be uploaded to a host to be consumed by users on the web. Build artifacts are located in `./www`. To build from source, open terminal and run:
```bash
ionic build
```
