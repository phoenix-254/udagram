## A Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service.

***
## Running the Server Locally

1. Setup environment variables for all the varibales used inside `src/config/config.ts`
2. Open terminal and run:
```bash
npm run dev

Developer mode runs off the TypeScript source. Any saves will reset the server and run the latest version of the codebase.
